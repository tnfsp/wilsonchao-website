/**
 * sync-lock.ts
 * Simple lock-file mechanism so sync-notion.ts and sync-vault.ts
 * cannot run at the same time and overwrite each other's output
 * in content/blog/.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   withSyncLock("sync-vault", main).catch(...)
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - Creates `.sync-lock` (next to content/, i.e. apps/main root) containing
 *   pid + owner + timestamp.
 * - If a lock already exists and is younger than 10 minutes, prints a message
 *   and exits (another sync is running).
 * - If the lock is older than 10 minutes it is considered stale (e.g. a
 *   previous sync crashed without cleanup) and is taken over.
 * - The lock is always released in a `finally` block, even when the sync fails.
